        <p id="corner1">Howdy! My name is Maggie Sturm and I am a Junior Computing major with a concentration in Cyber Security at Texas A&M University. <span class = "highlight">A-A-A WHOOP!!!</span>
            I made the decision to pursue the technological advancement industry when I was in high school. I had a teacher that pushed my limits and encouraged me to leave my comfort zone 
            and I exceeded my own expectations in the field of technology. This planted a seed and my love for coding, developing, and applied thinking began to grow. 
            At A&M, I have grown excited to learn everything that I can about developing, cyber security, object oriented design, and technology. I love
            taking opportunites I am blessed to recieve to advance my knowledge and become a better programmer, teammate, and person.
        </p>
  
        
    
            
        <p>Within a professional enviroment, I posess the skills to provide a better enviroment 
            for my peers and allowing all voices to be heard. I am a team leader and want what is best for everybody 
            in the workplace. Efficiency and strength is important so it is equally as important to nurture the enviroment in a way where
            productivity can thrive. 
        </p>
