            <h4>The project that I fell in love with was Dungeon Crawler
                in CSCE 121. This project challenged me very much as a programmer
                but also taught me more than I could've asked for. Through all the struggles,
                I definitly came out of the class better than I had gone in, becoming knowledgable in 
                2D arrays, loading in files, setting edge cases, and so much more. Resizing 
                the 2D array was a challenge but learning the mathematical moves behind 
                player move and monster attack was super complicated but, eventually, it all clicked.</thead></h4>
                <h4>
                I was challenged and forced to interact with resources the school provided
                which allowed me to become more open to asking for help. I had fun, during this
                assignment, and built friendships in ways I never thought possible.
                    think that, with the introduction of getters and setters,
                    it really assisted in going into the next class afterwards during my sophomore year.
