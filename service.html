            <p id="corner1">In ASC, we are introduced to many
                like minded girls who contribute to weekly bible studies and 
                invigorate meaningful conversations among a group of women. 
                We volunteer in communities around the Bryan/College Station Area 
                approximating 6 to 10 hours a semester. These volunteer locations include the 
                food bank, Salvation Army, the Hope Center, and so many more non-profit organizations</p>

            <h1><center>BIG EVENT</center></h1>
            <p id="corner1">For two years now, going on the third, Big Event has been a giant volunteer 
                event that occurs once a year. I have partaken in it with two different organizations and
                have been able to assist a church and a school in improving their outdoor facilties and 
                appearance. It has been a great experience every year, meeting the people and creating new friends.
                Last year, I operated as team lead and organized my group of volunteers.

            <h1><center>CHURCH</center></h1>
            <p id="corner1">During the summer and growing up, I help out with childrens care and teaching
                at the church that I attend. Being unpaid, you must still watch certification videos to ensure
                that one knows how to operate with a struggling child. I would build relationships and mentor the 
                children in their growth with Christ, morals, and ethics. This would be two times a week, on Sunday Mornings
                and Wednesday evenings.
